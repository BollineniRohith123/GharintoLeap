## üìä Business Logic Examples

### 1. Lead Assignment Algorithm
```typescript
// Automatic lead assignment based on:
// 1. Designer availability in same city
// 2. Current workload
// 3. Specialization match
// 4. Performance rating

const assignLead = async (leadId: number, city: string) => {
  const designer = await db.query`
    SELECT u.id, COUNT(l.id) as workload
    FROM users u
    JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
    JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
    LEFT JOIN leads l ON u.id = l.assigned_to 
    WHERE r.name = 'interior_designer' 
      AND u.city = ${city}
      AND u.is_active = true
    GROUP BY u.id
    ORDER BY workload ASC, u.created_at ASC
    LIMIT 1
  `;
  
  if (designer) {
    await assignLeadToDesigner(leadId, designer.id);
  }
};
```

### 2. Credit Recharge with Business Validation
```typescript
// Credit recharge with business rules:
// 1. Minimum ‚Çπ100, Maximum ‚Çπ10,00,000 per transaction
// 2. Daily limit of ‚Çπ5,00,000
// 3. KYC verification for amounts >‚Çπ50,000
// 4. Automatic bonus credits for bulk recharges

const rechargeCredits = async (amount: number, userId: number) => {
  // Validate amount limits
  if (amount < 100 || amount > 1000000) {
    throw new Error("Amount must be between ‚Çπ100 and ‚Çπ10,00,000");
  }
  
  // Check daily limit
  const todayRecharge = await getTodayRechargeAmount(userId);
  if (todayRecharge + amount > 500000) {
    throw new Error("Daily recharge limit exceeded");
  }
  
  // Add bonus for bulk recharges
  let bonusAmount = 0;
  if (amount >= 100000) bonusAmount = amount * 0.05; // 5% bonus
  else if (amount >= 50000) bonusAmount = amount * 0.03; // 3% bonus
  
  const totalAmount = amount + bonusAmount;
  
  // Process recharge...
};
```

### 3. Project Completion Workflow
```typescript
// Project completion with automatic tasks:
// 1. Final payment processing
// 2. Customer satisfaction survey
// 3. Designer performance rating
// 4. Commission calculation
// 5. Warranty period activation

const completeProject = async (projectId: number) => {
  await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Update project status
    await tx.query`UPDATE projects SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = ${projectId}`;
    
    // Process final payment
    await processFinalPayment(projectId);
    
    // Send satisfaction survey
    await sendCustomerSurvey(projectId);
    
    // Calculate commissions
    await calculateCommissions(projectId);
    
    // Activate warranty
    await activateWarranty(projectId);
  });
