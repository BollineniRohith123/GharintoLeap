# Backend Updates Log - Gharinto Interior Design Marketplace

## Current Status (Initial Assessment)
**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Phase**: Backend Production Readiness

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED SETUP
1. **Database Setup**
   - PostgreSQL 15 installed and configured
   - Database `gharinto_dev` created with proper credentials
   - All migrations executed successfully (001-005)

2. **Authentication & Security**
   - JWT-based authentication implemented with secure verification
   - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system fully functional
   - Dynamic menu system based on user roles working correctly
   - CORS properly configured for frontend origin only
   - All security vulnerabilities resolved
